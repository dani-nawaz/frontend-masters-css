# Lesson 2: Keyframes and animations

- [`@keyframes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes)
- [`animation-name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-name) (shorthand)
- [`animation-duration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration)
- [`animation-delay-delay`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay-delay)
- [`animation-timing-function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function)
- [`animation-fill-mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode)
- [`animation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) (shorthand)
- with keyframes we can define what happens b/w different states.
- animation explicitly define what happens b/w diff. states
- forwards = stickes to the top doesn't return to the natural position
- backward = place the element the at the start of the animation but it woon't stick to the top so in order to do that we have to apply ``` both ```
- both = sticky at the beginning, and the very end.
- animation-play-state:it can pause the animation

## Exercise

- Add an entry animation to the form.
- Create a shake animation; we will use this later.
