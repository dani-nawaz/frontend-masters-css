# Lesson 5: Layout animations

- FLIP technique
  1. First
  2. Last
  3. Invert
  4. Play
-  the FLIP technique which is an acronym for first, last, invert, and play. Rather than directly animating expensive properties like x, y, width, and height, the FLIP technique calculates the first and last position/size of an element and uses transform properties to create the animation.
## Exercise

- Apply the FLIP technique to the caption inside of the figure.
- Add choreography to the content so that it appears after the figure has moved.
