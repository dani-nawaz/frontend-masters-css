- David explains that, unlike state or layout animations, reactive animations are based on continuous input. An example would be an element following the mouse. The pointermove event can be used to capture the position of any pointer device. CSS custom properties can make the pointers position available in CSS.
-  the Lerp technique which stands for linear interpolation. This technique creates a reactive animation by continuously calculating where an element should be, but instead of transforming the element to that position, the element moves a fraction of the way there. After the Lerp technique is applied to the ball, additional examples of using reactive animations are explored.
